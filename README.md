# Data Privacy Debate in the Modern Era: How to address the concern
  In this document, I discuss two articles that hold different views on data privacy: one argues for giving up privacy in the modern world, while the other suggests that this serious problem should be handled by individual companies, and that privacy is an important right for humans. I present and discuss two opposing views in the following paragraphs.

## Article 1
  In **Kaja Molinksa** 's [In the digital age, we should not expect our online activities to remain private](https://debatingmatters.com/topic/online_privacy/), the author argues that people need to realize privacy is the price we pay in using internet, because of three reasons. First and foremost, expecting privacy in today's world where most activities are done online through searching engines or social networks is simply impossible. The only way to avoid leaking your personal information is to avoid any online activities, since algrithoms would track you down by various means, including cookies. Second, remaining completely anonymous can have the opposite effect: that is, increasing more crime and illegal online activities, an effect known as online disinhibition. Moreover, access to data is predominantly beneficial to some extent, both to consumers and business owners, as it delivers a "personalised experience to the former while providing 'cost-effective, targeted advertising'" to the latter.

  Given that her points are valid, I don't think this justify the intrusive acts inflicted by various businesses, and the extent to which they violate privacy right is well-beyond the 'cost-effective, targeted advertising' need. Access to photos, for instance, is completely unnecessary in the marketing perspective. There is definitely a degree to it - losing some privacy (e.g. browing history on shopping websties) doesn't imply that we have to lose it all. 

## Article 2
  In contrast, **Dr.Rob Nicholls** and **Dr.Peter Leonard**, in their article [_Three useful things to know about data, AI and the privacy debate_](https://www.businessthink.unsw.edu.au/articles/data-AI-privacy-debate) published on Business Think, contend that, instead of blaming AI, data science, or the algothrim itself, or arguing that losing privacy is unavoidable, people should realize that it's the human decision that matters afterall. According to them, data privacy does not have a dichomotized answer; instead, organisations and companies should take the responsibility to decide whether they should utilize the algothrim. Indeed, as Rob concluded, 
  
>“The issues to be addressed are not black and white issues of can I, can’t I? Instead, they’re much more complex issues around “what should a **responsible** organisation do, or not do?” 

  I strongly agree with Rob and Peter's argument, since an algothrim has no inherent morality - it depends on how the users apply it, under which circumstances and in what context. Hence, in the data privacy debate, we should pay more attention to whether the companies decideds to employ it or not.
